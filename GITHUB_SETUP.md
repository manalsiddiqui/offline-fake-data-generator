   - **Visibility**: ✅ Public (for open source)
   - **Initialize**: ❌ Don't initialize (you have files already)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Local Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/athan/directory

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .
